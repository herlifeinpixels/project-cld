# Bi-Weekly Collective Leadership Digest
[Fill out a form to join](submit)


**Who?** This space is run by and for women who lead, teach, and organize, in and outside of our job. We make use of our collective experiences to grow one another to be more effective in what we love to do.

**Why?** There are plenty of empowerment spaces for women. But oftentimes, topics discussed tend to lead into emotional needs, while not providing much strategic guidance. The space is an experiment on a new way to support and invest in each other's growth with high quality, crowdsourced feedback async peer mentorship. See _guidelines_ of how to contribute.

**Format**: Every 2 weeks members will be prompted to optionally share one output for feedback and one struggle you would like input from others.

Is this just for people in tech? No! In fact I'd love to have more perspective from leaders outside of tech.

## FAQ
**I'm not a leader, organizer, or teacher but want to be one, can I join?**

There are plenty of spaces where aspiring leaders can ask questions but fewer spaces where people who already do can swap notes with peers going through the same motions, this is one of them.

Almost all of our members give back and mentor on their own time. A good place to start is to our _public Q&A_.

**Why only women?** 

Many of our members already have male co-workers, mentors and supporters. While we are thankful to the perspectives they bring, it is extremely valuable to exchange knowledge with people whom we identify with and have faced similar challenges. We hope that our _public Q&A_ brings a valuable perspective into these challenges we face and showcases our ingenuity.

**I'm looking for emotional support / a space to vent, can I do it here?**

We value everyone's time in providing perspectives. With that said, there are plenty of alternative and ad-hoc channels to vent. This is not a space were other members are asked to provide emotional labour. What we do share are _strategies that worked for us_. If you can frame your questions to demonstrate your _willingness to take action towards a positive outcome_, then this is a space for you.

## Rules for Answering
1. Share things **you have done** that **worked for you**. Please only advise based on personal experiences and not what you think people should do hypothetically.
2. **Respect confidentiality**. The things that your peers share are to remain within our space unless permission is given to share them in the public _Q&A_.
3. Provide constructive feedback. 

## Rules for Asking
1. Provide context to your problem. Keep it as brief as possible. 
2. What have you tried already?
3. What kinds of input are you seeking?
4. Should this question remain confidential?
5. We'll share this on our Q&A for others to learn, would you like to remain anonymous?
6. Is this issue time sensitive?
